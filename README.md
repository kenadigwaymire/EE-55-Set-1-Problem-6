# EE 55 Set 1 Problem 6

## 6.1
The visual quality of this image is quite bad. It's very hard to make out the boat; you can tell that there *is* a shape there, but it's way too choppy and unclear to actually make out what it is supposed to represent. The top portion of the image is almost completely white, which makes looking at the overall image a little painful because it's just so overwhelmingly bright.

## 6.2
The visual qualities of the first and second images (done with the 0.5 and 5 variance values, respectively) are quite similar. In fact, they look like the exact same image, at least to my eyes. These pictures are definitely more pleasant to look at than the (solely) quantized image, as it is made up of softer greys rather than just pure black and white, but it is still somewhat difficult to make out what the image actually represents. I am able to make out the water quite well, and the immediate front of the first ship, but the further up we go in the image, the harder it is to distinguish shapes.

The visual quality of the third image is quite distinct from the first two. This one is much more akin to something like TV static, and it's harsher to look at. However, by squinting at the picture, it's possible to make out the water, some parts of the front of the front ship, and some shadows beneath it.
