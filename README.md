# EE 55 Set 1 Problem 6

## 6.1
The visual quality of this image is quite bad. You can make out each boat and the water and every major structure/shape in the photo, but it's very harsh to look at. The bright whites of the sky and ocean kind of hurt my eyes while looking at it. 

## 6.2
The visual qualities of the first and second images (done with the 0.5 and 5 variance values, respectively) are quite similar. In fact, they look almost the exact same, but the 5 variance value photo is just a little bit noisier. These pictures are definitely more pleasant to look at than the (solely) quantized image, as it is made up of softer greys rather than just pure black and white. The quality of these photos is much better than that of the quantized-only picture; it's much easier to make out details.

The third image is much noisier than the other two randomized pictures. I will say that it's still more pleasant to look at than the solely quantized photo, but details are a bit harder to make out than the better quality pictures.
